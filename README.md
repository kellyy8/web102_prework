## Notes

While implementing this application, one challenge I encountered was destructuring arrays and Objects. During my first iteration, the variables initialized through destructuring an array worked, but not the ones initialized through destructuring with Objects. The latter only initialized the last variable in a group of space-separated variables. I used the console log to debug, referred to documentations, and tested the documentation's sample code to get an understanding of how destructuring worked with different variable types. After that, I realized how correct my syntax and successfully destructure Object variables.
